# Country Select with ReasonReact

This is:
- A small task for Ahrefs interview;

I have used ReactRedux with hooks template so I kept the structure they proposed.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're developing**!
